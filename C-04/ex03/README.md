**## Documentation for `ft_atoi`**

**Functionality:**

The `ft_atoi` function takes a character pointer (`str`) as input, which points to a string that potentially represents an integer. It iterates through the string and extracts the numerical part, converting it into a corresponding integer value. The function handles whitespace characters, signs (positive/negative), and digits to produce the final integer.

**Logic Breakdown:**

1. **Skipping Whitespace:**
   - Uses `ft_isspace` to skip leading whitespace characters (space, tab, newline, etc.) until a non-whitespace character is encountered.

2. **Handling Signs:**
   - Uses `ft_issign` to check for plus or minus signs.
     - If a minus sign (`-`) is found, a flag (`j`) is set to indicate a negative number.
     - Advances to the next character.

3. **Converting Digits:**
   - Uses `ft_isnumber` to check for digits (`0` to `9`) while also ensuring the null terminator (`\0`) hasn't been reached.
   - For each digit:
     - Multiplies the current `number` by 10 to shift existing digits left.
     - Subtracts `'0'` from the character to convert it to its numerical value.
     - Adds the numerical value to `number`.
     - Advances to the next character.

4. **Returning the Result:**
   - If the negative flag (`j`) is set, returns the negative of `number` using unary minus (`-`).
   - Otherwise, returns `number` as a positive integer.

**Key Points:**

- Handles whitespace, signs, and digits for accurate conversion.
- Relies on helper functions (`ft_isspace`, `ft_issign`, `ft_isnumber`) for character classification.
- Assumes a null-terminated string input (`\0`).
- Understanding of ASCII values, character manipulation, and loops in C is helpful.
