This code snippet defines a `main` function that iterates through command-line arguments and prints them in reverse order, one argument per line. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

**Functionality:**

1. **Iterating Through Arguments (Reverse Order):**
   - The `main` function starts with the last argument (`argc - 1`) using the `i` variable.
   - A `while` loop continues as long as `i` is greater than 0 (skipping the program name itself). This ensures it iterates through actual arguments provided.

2. **Printing Each Argument:**
   - Inside the outer loop, another `while` loop iterates through each character of the current argument (`argv[i]`).
     - It uses a `j` variable as a counter to access characters within the argument string.
     - The loop continues until the null terminator (`\0`) of the string is encountered.
     - Inside the inner loop, the function calls `ft_putchar` (assumed to be defined elsewhere) to print each character of the current argument.

3. **Adding Newline:**
   - After printing all characters of the current argument, the function calls `ft_putchar` again to print a newline character (`\n`) to separate arguments in the output.

4. **Decrementing Counter:**
   - The outer loop counter (`i`) is decremented in each iteration to move to the previous argument for printing in the next loop.

5. **Exiting the Program:**
   - The function returns 0 to indicate successful program execution.

**Compiling and Running the Code:**

1. Save the code in a file named `ft_strcmp.c`.
2. Compile the code using a command like:

```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
./a.out
```
The output will be the arguments printed in reverse order, each on a new line (e.g., for the above command, the output might be:

```
argument3
argument2
argument1
```
