## Documentation for `ft_putchar.c`

This document covers the source code for a function named `ft_putchar`.

**Functionality**

The code provides a function `ft_putchar` that prints a single character to the standard output. 

**Explanation**

1. **Header Inclusion:**
   - `#include <unistd.h>`: This line includes the standard POSIX library for operating system functions.

2. **Function Definition:** 
   - `void ft_putchar(char c)`: This declares a function named `ft_putchar` that takes a character (`char`) as input and doesn't return any value (`void`).

3. **Function Body:**
   - `write(1, &c, 1);`:  This line uses the `write` function from the `unistd.h` library. 
     - The first argument (`1`) specifies the file descriptor for standard output (the console).
     - The second argument (`&c`) is the address of the character (`c`) passed to the function. This is done using the address-of operator (`&`). 
     - The third argument (`1`) indicates the number of bytes to write, which is 1 in this case (a single character).

**Running the Code**

**Requirements:**

  - A C compiler (e.g., GCC)

**Instructions:**

1. Save the code as `ft_putchar.c`.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3. Compile the code using the following command:

```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c
```

   - This command instructs the GCC compiler to compile `ft_putchar.c` and create an executable file named `./a.out`.
4. Run the program by typing:

```bash
./a.out
```

   - This will execute the `./a.out` program and print the character 'A' (assuming the `main` function is uncommented) to the console.


This documentation provides a basic explanation of the code and how to run it. Remember to consider error handling and expand functionality based on your specific programming needs.
