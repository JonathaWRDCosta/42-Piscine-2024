## Documentation for `ft_is_negative.c`

This document covers the source code for a function named `ft_is_negative` and a commented-out `main` function, compiled using the command `cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c`.

**Functionality**

The code provides a function `ft_is_negative` that checks if a given integer is negative and prints either "N" (negative) or "P" (positive) to the standard output (console).

**Explanation**

1. **Compilation Instruction:**
   - The provided compilation instruction is: `cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c`
     - This command instructs the C compiler (`cc`) to compile all C source files (`.c` files) in the current directory.
     - The flags used are:
        - `-Wall`: Enables most warnings from the compiler.
        - `-Wextra`: Enables additional warnings that might be helpful.
        - `-Werror`: Treats all warnings as errors, causing the compilation to fail if any warnings are found.
     - This will create an executable file named `a.out` by default.

2. **Code Breakdown:**
   - `#include <unistd.h>`: This line includes the standard POSIX library for operating system functions. The `write` function used later is defined in this library.

   - `void ft_is_negative(int n)`: This declares a function named `ft_is_negative` that takes an integer argument `n` and doesn't return any value (`void`).

   - `if (n < 0)`: This line starts an `if` statement that checks if the value of `n` is less than zero (negative).
     - If the condition is true (`n` is negative):
       - `write(1, "N", 1);`: The `write` function is used to print the character 'N' (negative) to the standard output (console). The arguments specify the file descriptor (1 for standard output), the string to print ("N"), and the number of bytes to write (1 in this case).

   - `else`: If the `if` condition is false (not negative):
     - `write(1, "P", 1);`: The `write` function is used to print the character 'P' (positive) to the standard output.

**Running the Code**

1. Save the code as a file named `ft_is_negative.c`.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3. Compile the code using the provided command:

   ```bash
   cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c
   ```

4. **Uncomment the main function (optional):**
   - The provided code includes a commented-out `main` function. You can uncomment the lines within the `main` function to test the `ft_is_negative` function with different integer values. 

5. Run the program by typing:

   ```bash
   ./a.out
   ```

   - This will execute the `main` function (if uncommented) and call the `ft_is_negative` function for various integer values, printing "N" or "P" for each value based on its sign.

This documentation provides a basic explanation of the code, compilation instructions, and potential vulnerabilities. Remember to consider error handling and expand functionality based on your specific programming needs.
