## Documentation for `ft_print_reverse_alphabet.c`

This document covers the source code for a function named `ft_print_reverse_alphabet`.

**Functionality**

The code provides a function `ft_print_reverse_alphabet` that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order (from 'z' to 'a') to the standard output.

**Explanation**

1. **Header Inclusion:**
   - `#include <unistd.h>`: This line includes the standard POSIX library for operating system functions.

2. **Function Definition:** 
   - `void ft_print_reverse_alphabet(void)`: This declares a function named `ft_print_reverse_alphabet` that doesn't take any arguments (`void`) and doesn't return any value (`void`).

3. **Function Body:**
   - `int a;`: This line declares an integer variable `a`.
   - `a = 122;`: This line initializes the variable `a` with the ASCII value of 'z' (122).
   - `while (a >= 97)`: This line starts a `while` loop that continues as long as `a` is greater than or equal to 97 (ASCII value of 'a').
     - `write(1, &a, 1);`: Inside the loop, the `write` function from `unistd.h` is used to print a character. 
       - The first argument (`1`) specifies the file descriptor for standard output (the console).
       - The second argument (`&a`) is the address of the integer `a`. In this case, we're treating the integer value (ASCII code) as a character. This is because the `write` function operates on bytes and interprets the value at the memory location as a character.
       - The third argument (`1`) indicates the number of bytes to write, which is 1 in this case (a single character).
     - `a--;`: After printing the character, the value of `a` is decremented by 1 to move on to the next letter in the reverse alphabet order.


**Running the Code**

**Requirements:**

  - A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
  - A POSIX-compliant operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS)

**Instructions:**

1. Save the code as `ft_print_reverse_alphabet.c`.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3. Compile the code using the following command:

```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c
```

   - This command instructs the GCC compiler to compile `ft_print_reverse_alphabet.c` and create an executable file named `a.out`.
4. Run the program by typing:

```bash
./a.out
```

   - This will execute the `a.out` program and print the lowercase alphabet in reverse order to the console (assuming the `main` function is uncommented).
