## Documentation for `ft_print_numbers.c`

This document covers the source code for a function named `ft_print_numbers` compiled using the command `cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c`.

**Functionality**

The code provides a function `ft_print_numbers` that prints the digits from 0 to 9 to the standard output (console).

**Explanation**

1. **Compilation Instruction:**
   - The provided compilation instruction is: `cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c`
     - This command instructs the C compiler (`cc`) to compile all C source files (`.c` files) in the current directory.
     - The flags used are:
        - `-Wall`: Enables most warnings from the compiler.
        - `-Wextra`: Enables additional warnings that might be helpful.
        - `-Werror`: Treats all warnings as errors, causing the compilation to fail if any warnings are found.
     - This will create an executable file named `a.out` by default.

2. **Code Breakdown:**
   - `#include <unistd.h>`: This line includes the standard POSIX library for operating system functions. The `write` function used later is defined in this library.

   - `void ft_print_numbers(void)`: This declares a function named `ft_print_numbers` that doesn't take any arguments (`void`) and doesn't return any value (`void`).

   - `int a;`: This line declares an integer variable `a`.

   - `a = 48;`: This line initializes the variable `a` with the ASCII value of '0' (48).

   - `while (a <= 57)`: This line starts a `while` loop that continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to 57 (ASCII value of '9').

     - `write(1, &a, 1);`: Inside the loop, the `write` function from `unistd.h` is used to print a character.
        - The first argument (`1`) specifies the file descriptor for standard output (the console).
        - The second argument (`&a`) is the address of the integer `a`. In this case, we're treating the integer value (ASCII code) as a character. This is a common trick in C to print characters using their numeric codes.
        - The third argument (`1`) indicates the number of bytes to write, which is 1 in this case (a single character).

     - `a++;`: After printing the character, the value of `a` is incremented by 1 to move on to the next digit.

**Running the Code**

1. Save the code as a file named `ft_print_numbers.c`.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3. Compile the code using the provided command:

   ```bash
   cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c
   ```

4. Run the program by typing:

   ```bash
   ./a.out
   ```

   - This will execute the `ft_print_numbers` function and print the digits 0 to 9 to the console.
